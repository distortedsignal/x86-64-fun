Having some fun with x86-64 assembly.
-------------------------------------

After reading part of [this blog post](http://nickdesaulniers.github.io/blog/2014/04/18/lets-write-some-x86-64/) about working in x86-64 assembly, I felt the seductive call of my electrical engineering past to write code at **the lowest level possible**. As such, I fired up my Linux VM and set to work. What you're seeing here are the results that I want you to see. Are these complete? Probably not. Along the road to learning, there are many humiliating failures, and I think that I might prefer to keep those hidden. If you're intrigued, most of this code should run on any recent Fedora install (20+), and it might work on any Red Hat Linux install, so spin up a machine, check out the code and tinker! Have fun!
